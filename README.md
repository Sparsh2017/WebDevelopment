# WebDevelopment

The following changes are made:-

* Home button of most of the pages (only reg.html was working) were non functional, we implemented that.
* Meet us here directed to the same page - we directed it to the official site of hertz.
* Added link to register at every page, So that user immediately can register if he/she is inetrested.
* Added navigation bar to every event page for better navigation.
* Added hover to the event list for better user experience and changed the styles.
* Just for fun we have added a count down for sparsh to end :-)
* Spelling Mistakes corrected.


Note: type-forms in the Registration page need to add few validations regarding the phone number.
 The site doesnot provide any such validation scheme thus we were unable to fix that bug thinking were we allowed to do so or not.
